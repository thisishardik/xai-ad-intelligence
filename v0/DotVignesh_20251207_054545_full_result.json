Subtle collaborative elements like a shared screen icon or cloud sync badge in the corner. Bold headline overlay: 'Autodesk Flex: Pay-as-you-go tokens for Revit, AutoCAD &amp; more.' Subtext: 'Tokens expire in a year. Perfect for occasional projects. Only pay when designing.' Prominent 'Learn more' CTA button and Autodesk logo at bottom. Premium, optimistic mood with focused lighting, high-quality realistic style evoking ingenuity and efficiency for designers/engineers in hackathons or research—clean composition, tech-forward vibe with neutral colors (whites, blues, grays) for social media impact.",
