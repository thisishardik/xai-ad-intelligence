        "image_prompt": "Top-down view of a clean, modern tech workspace for AI/ML devs: high-end laptop screen split between AutoCAD/Revit model and Python code editor with API calls (e.g., generative design scripts), multi-monitor setup with GPU indicators, headphones, sleek black mug, notebook with sketches, soft natural light for optimistic, professional mood. Overlay text: 'Autodesk Flex: Pay-as-you-go for Revit, AutoCAD &amp; more 🚀' with subtle 'Learn more' button and Autodesk logo at bottom. High-quality, premium feel — clean whites/blues, no clutter, emphasizing flexible real-world design workflow for hackathons or prototypes.",
        "enhancement_notes": "Builds on original's clean workspace and 'Flex in flexibility' pun vibe by tailoring to AI/ML audience: adds code/ML workflow on screen (truthful to tools, no fake results), tech hardware like GPUs for hackathon relevance, keeps optimistic premium tone. Replaces generic props with dev-focused items for better resonance; boldens 🚀 emoji and concise headline for social media pop while preserving all original claims.",
